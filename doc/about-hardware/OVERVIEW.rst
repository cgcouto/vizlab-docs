VizLab hardware overview
========================

Computer system
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you go inside the closet in the corner of the VizLab you'll see a giant server rack with many components. As a general rule you won't have to touch anything on the rack unless the troubleshooting guide suggests it!

Motion tracking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The VizLab uses four infrared tracking cameras which search for the positions and orientations of certain trackables within the space.

The glasses are circularly polarized to work with the interleaved rendering, while the controller is a off-the-shelf Logitech F710. 

Screens
^^^^^^^

The screens are Planar Clarity Matrix panels which are specially designed for vertically interleaved stereo rendering. 

Speaker setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The VizLab's speaker setup is great for videos and music, both on their own and integrated into Unity apps. To drive the sound, the computer rack has an Integra DRS-2.3. receiver. To get good sound, the digital output at 100% volume and the receiver at 50% volume is a good starting point!
