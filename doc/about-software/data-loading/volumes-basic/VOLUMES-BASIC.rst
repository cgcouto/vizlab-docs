The starting dataset is called 'orb.h5'. It contains a 3D density array that, when visualized, depicts a colored spherical orb.

Process such that it is compatible
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There's no pre-processing needed for this dataset, as it's a simple 3D array that the software automatically supports.

Load in the software
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you've got the data file, put it on the VizLab, start up the software and use the 'Load from disk' option on the radial menu to load it in. You'll want to assign each dataset in the menu as shown below: 

.. image:: /images/basicVolumeMenu.png
   :target: /images/basicVolumeMenu.png

The data should load in under the 'default' colormap for volumes and look like this:
