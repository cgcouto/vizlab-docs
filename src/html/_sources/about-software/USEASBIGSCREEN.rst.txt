Using the system as a standard Windows machine
----------------------------------------------

Since the VizLab runs Windows, you can use it just like any other Windows system, just with a very large screen attached! Read on to learn how to do that effectively.

(1) Get your content onto the VizLab screen
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The VizLab desktop is oriented "above" the large screen, so to move content from the desktop screen to the VizLab screen, drag it down to the bottom of the desktop screen and it will appear on the VizLab screen.

Once you've dragged it onto the big display, use the keyboard shortcut ``Windows key + F11`` to make it go full-screen across the entire display.

As for content to show on the screen, you have two choices: remote content via Zoom or local content that's directly on the system.

(2) Running a Zoom meeting and sharing content remotely via screen share
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The easiest approach for getting content onto the screen is by starting a Zoom session on the VizLab machine, then joining from your personal machine and sharing screen. There's a dedicated zoom room for this purpose, the details of which are found in a sticky note on the system desktop.

When you share screen the window on the VizLab screen will change size. As such, to get everything set up properly follow these instructions:

* Get zoom set up
* Share screen from your laptop
* Move the zoom screen on the VizLab machine onto the big screen
* Resize the zoom screen to be large enough on the VizLab screen with ``Windows key + F11`` or by dragging the corner.

(3) Showing local content (presentations, Chrome, etc.) across the screen
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For sharing local content, you have multiple options: going through a web browser (with or without signing into a account to do so) or by uploading your content to the VizLab's Google Drive folder, which automatically syncs to the system. 

Then like before, drag it onto the main display and use the ``Windows key + F11`` keyboard shortcut to make it full-screen across the display.
