Audio issues
------------

There's no sound coming out of the speakers!

First, make sure the Integra receiver on the server rack is set to TV mode and at a sensible volume, as shown below.

Also confirm that the audio levels in Windows are set to output audio along 'Digital output' on the Xonar sound card. You can adjust sound settings in Windows via the volume icon in the system tray.

A good starting sound level is 100% on the digital output and 50% on the receiver.
